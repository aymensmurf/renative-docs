## Overview


Every app configuration flavour contains its own `renative.*.json` file used to extend overall config with configurations specific to app flavour


Configurations typically stored in your project `appConfigs/[APP_ID]/renative.json` :

- App id, Title, Description etc
- Active / inactive plugins
- Plugin overrides per app
- Build schemes
- Runtime injections
